          Iâ€™m a Software Developer with expertise in <b>Backend development</b> with <b>Java</b>, <b>Spring Universe</b>, and <b>Kotlin</b>.<br/>
          Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the Software Engineering program at <b>Ã‰cole 42|Rio</b>, with an expected graduation in 2025. 42 is ranked as the 6th most innovative university in the world by the <b>WURI</b> ranking. This prestigious recognition is a testament to 42â€™s unique approach to education, which focuses on project-based learning, gamification, and self-directed study. Using languages like <b>C</b> and <b>C++</b>, Iâ€™m honing my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and self-management, while strengthening both my technical and <b>soft skills</b>.
          In parallel, Iâ€™m pursuing a degree in <b>Computer Systems</b> at the Fluminense Federal University (<b>UFF</b>), from 2024 to 2027. UFF is providing me with a solid theoretical foundation in computer science, complementing my practical experience at 42.
          I believe the combination of 42â€™s hands-on approach and UFFâ€™s theoretical grounding will equip me to become a highly skilled Software Engineer, prepared for the challenges of the job market.<br/>
